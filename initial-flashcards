What is a factorial design? When an experiment has a two or more independent variables it is called a factorial design.

Name the types of factorial designs. Describe.
1. Independent factorial design: Several independent variables or predictors and each has been measured using different entities, meaning we are comparing between groups.
2. Repeated-measures (related) factorial design: several independent variables or predictors have been measured but you use the same group of people for each one of these condidtions. 
3. Mixed-design: Design where several independent variables or predictors have been measured where some predictors measure different entities and other predictors measure the same entities.

Is a factorial ANOVA a linear model? Yes.
